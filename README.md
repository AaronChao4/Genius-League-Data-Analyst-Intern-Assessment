# Genius League Data Analyst Intern Assessment
This is an assessment for the Genius League Data Analyst Internship. Evil Geniuses has provided us with a data set. This data set includes information regarding posts from Evil Geniuses's social media accounts. We will be answering a series of questions to come up with a strategy to expand Evil Geniuses's social channels.

The data set includes the following columns:
| Column  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Published Date | Date when post was published in "MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM" format  |
| Account | Account (CSGO, DOTA2, Valorant, General, Content Creators) |
| Acccount Type | Social media platform (TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) |
| Campaign Name | Name of campaign |
| Total Impressions | Number of times a post was seen |
| Total Engagements | Number of interactions |
| Media Type | Format of post |

## **Task**
We are given the following questions to answer:
1. What is the typical engagement rate we can expect? Whatâ€™s the likelihood that we can
achieve a 15% engagement rate?
2. Does day of the week and time of posting affect engagement rates?
3. How are our game titles doing in terms of social performance? Is there a specific game
we should focus more on or less?
4. What media type performs the best?
5. What is our best performing campaign?
6. Define out a posting strategy for our social channels based on your discoveries.
7. What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their
presence (e.g. if our CSGO youtube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?

To complete this task, we first clean up the data and create charts to analyze our data using Excel. The Excel file that includes the original data, the cleaned data, and the graphs/charts can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronChao4/DA-Intern-Assessment/blob/main/social_data_edited_05_26_23.xlsx). Finally, we present our findings in this [powerpoint](https://github.com/AaronChao4/DA-Intern-Assessment/blob/main/DA%20Intern%20Assessment%20Powerpoint%20(PPT%20File).pptx), or if a PDF file is preferred for easy readability, it can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronChao4/DA-Intern-Assessment/blob/main/DA%20Intern%20Assessment%20Powerpoint%20(PDF%20File).pdf).
